            Welcome to Recipes from Baba, my recipe archive site for my favorite childhood dishes from growing up with my <i>Baba</i> (Chinese for Dad).</p>
         <p>Here you'll find archaic lists that could pass as recipes if you squint, truly representative of how my Dad, and most Chinese parents, tackle cooking. Give them a try if you dare, and feel free to be creative- these are designed as bases, for you to experiment and get creative with them!
