            <img src="media/rice wine.jpg" class=imgL alt="Yuu Yee brand Chinese Rice Cooking Wine with clear liquid"> <b>Cooking Wine</b>: Dad uses Rice Wine, the clear stuff, not the dark brown stuff. You could also substitute it for Mirin for a sweeter taste.

            <img src="media/mushroom-dark-soy-sauce-2.jpg" class=imgL alt="Pearl River Bridge Mushroom Flavored Superior Dark Soy Sauce"><b>Dark Soy Sauce</b>: There’s 2 kinds of soy sauce used in Chinese cooking- light is the common stuff, and then dark is the super secret special stuff (not that super secret). There IS a difference and it DOES matter, so you do have to get the dark mushroom soy sauce from the store.

            <img src="media/green onions.png" class=imgL alt="Green onions"><b>Green Onions</b>: Definitely not chives or leeks, but specifically <b>green onions</b>. Dad yells at me for suggesting they could <i>possibly</i> be interchangable (I think they are), so I'm putting this on the page at his request..
